# Context Menus

This app is a demonstration of the use of context menus in iOS.

The globe can be long pressed to change color. The color itself and the color name are displayed for each button in the context menu, and the current selected color will have a checkmark displayed next to it.

The caption can be long pressed to change text content. The caption is displayed for each button in the context menu, and the current selected caption will have a checkmark displayed next to it.
